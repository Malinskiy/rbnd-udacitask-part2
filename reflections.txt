Used terminal-table gem to make output a bit clearer and nicer

Added 2 features:
* sleep item (very important in life :) )
* removal of multiple items


Q: How long did you spend working on this project?
A: 2 hrs

Q: What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
A: Thinking how to implement the similar behavior in multiple classes

Q: What two additional features did you build? Why?
A: new item type and removal of multiple tasks.
    because sleep is very important in life and sometimes you forget to remove a task from todo and you need to
    remove several of them in one call

Q: Where do you still have room to grow?
A: All types are currently hardcoded in classes and also in udacilist. Probably need some kind of RTTI to check all
    child classes of BaseItem
